        This website is a small space of remembrance, created with love for our grandparents - Benjamin Abraham
        and Molly Benjamin.

        To those who knew them well, they were anchors of family and home. To those who met them briefly, they
        left warmth that
        lingered. And to those who never had the chance to meet them, this space offers a glimpse into who they
        were and what they meant.

        Here you will find photographs, memories, stories, and moments from their lives—simple things that
        together tell a beautiful story. This is not meant to be a complete account, but a heartfelt one.

        bring comfort, reflection, and a sense of connection—just as they did in life.

          <p class="lead">
            Benjamin Abraham, lovingly known as Appapa, was a man of quiet strength, steadiness, and deep integrity. He
            carried responsibility with calm resolve, anchoring his family through years of change, migration, and hard
            work. A devoted husband and father, he built a life grounded in faith, discipline, and perseverance, often
            placing family above personal ambition. He valued simplicity, routine, and doing things the right way,
            without noise or display. His presence was reassuring rather than loud—felt more than spoken. Even in
            silence, he taught by example: how to endure, how to provide, and how to stand steady so others could lean
            on him.

          <p class="lead">
            Molly Benjamin, lovingly known as Ammama, lived a life defined by quiet strength, resilience, and generosity
            of spirit. Married young and far from home, she raised her family through years of uncertainty with courage,
            faith, and humour. She balanced a playful, childlike joy with an indomitable inner resolve—laughing easily,
            loving deeply, and never taking herself too seriously. A natural caregiver, she found her greatest happiness
            in nurturing others, whether as a mother, grandmother, entrepreneur, or friend. She cherished simple
            pleasures, valued integrity over wealth, and helped anyone in need without distinction. Even in adversity,
            her instinct was always to ask if everyone had eaten, if everyone was cared for. Her legacy lives on in her
            compassion, perseverance, and the warmth she brought into every life she touched.

        <p>
          I knew Uncle & Aunty from my school days when Meena, the new student joined our class.
          But what Babu & I remember vividly is how they would stop by our house on the way to Meena's place in the
          evenings. Those visits were never planned never hurried. They would come in, sit for a while & chat about
          everyday things, about whatever was on their minds that day. In those moments they filled our home with
          warmth, familiarity & comforting sense of belonging.
          We also remember the ease of their presence. There was kindness in their voices, genuine interest in
          conversation & the quiet grace in the way they related to our children who were very young then.
          We will always remember them with deep affection, love & respect.

          I know Benjamin Abraham since I came to Panampilly Nagar in the year 1976. First related to the church and
          then in connection with the P N W A. I am sure that most of his time he used it for the benefit of others. Let
          his memory be evergreen with us always.

      <div class="testimonial">
        <p>
          I knew both Appa and Amma being my best friend and classmate Meena's parents. she was a Mom to me like she was
          to Meena, Biju and Betina.

          Appa I have very few meetings but he always had a smile to greet anyone who came home.

          Amma!!! was more known to me and such a loving Amma. Once we stayed back at home and next day morning my other
          classmate and me were travelling from Cochin to Trivandrum. Amma got up and made sandwiches for us early
          morning. I went to her and said why bother and she said with affection "it's ok but eat it".
          Everytime I meet her she was so loving and caring. Love you Amma.

          Miss her and had met when she was bed ridden and had a memory challenge.

          May her soul rest in peace and may she be happy wherever she is... Love to Amma.
          God give divine peace to both is the.

          Molly Aunty’s ( now that I think about it, she’s my aunt’s mom and I must have settled for “Aunty” since
          that’s what I heard growing up ) love language was food. I was raised on the magic she wove into food that
          included her juices ( was craving that beetroot juice just last week..sigh!) and jams. Just like how Marcel
          Proust was reminded of his mother while feasting on some tea-drenched madeleines, my association with her has
          gifted me with a bunch of food that can evoke a “remembrance of things past” and take me on a nostalgic trip
          right into my childhood. Isn’t that a big enough impression someone can leave on others? :)
